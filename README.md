# Hospitality Data Analysis using Power BI

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The hospitality industry is highly dynamic, with fluctuating booking trends, seasonal demands, and customer preferences playing a crucial role in revenue generation. This project focuses on analyzing hospitality data to gain insights into business performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

Using Power BI, we have created an interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights into:
âœ… Booking patterns â€“ Peak seasons, busiest days, and customer trends

This analysis helps hospitality businesses optimize pricing strategies, improve customer experience, and enhance overall efficiency.
